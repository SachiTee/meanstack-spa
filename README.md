# MEAN STACK Single Page Web App
This app was created with purpose to serve up mock data from a locally generated backend server that can talk to an Angular framework to send and retrieve data from a form. 

M - MongoDB Community Edition 4.0 [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

E - Express (https://expressjs.com/)

A - Angular 7 [Angular CLI] (https://cli.angular.io/)

N - Node.js 10.15.3 (https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Getting Started

#### Installation
To install the necessary packages, use the following command in both the root and /backend 

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server
Navigate to the /backend 
use the following commands

```bash
mongod
npm run dev
```

Run `ng serve` for a dev server in root. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Themes
Themes can easily be modified from the `themes/` directory for customization.  

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
